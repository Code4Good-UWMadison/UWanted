As coding becomes more and more widely used across academics, lots of labs and students from majors other than Computer Sciences may want to use coding as a tool to do something. For example, a biology lab may need a short script in Python to do a data analysis. It will be nice if there's a platform on campus that can let labs and students from other majors to post requests about this kind of specific technical assistance.
